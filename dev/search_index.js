As an example, say you're running a clinical trial to investigate the efficacy of a new anticonvulsant. You may be interested in the time from the start of therapy to the first epileptic seizure for each patient. But if a patient dies or otherwise goes off study before they have a seizure, you'll assume that a seizure would have occurred eventually, but you don't know when exactly. In this case the event time is right censored; the true event time is unknown, all you know is that it exceeds the observed time.","category":"page"},{"location":"events/","page":"Event Times","title":"Event Times","text":"A dedicated type is provided to conveniently store right censored data.","category":"page"},{"location":"events/","page":"Event Times","title":"Event Times","text":"Survival.EventTime","category":"page"},{"location":"events/#Survival.EventTime","page":"Event Times","title":"Survival.EventTime","text":"EventTime{T}\n\nImmutable object containing the real-valued time to an event as well as an indicator of whether the time corresponds to an observed event (true) or right censoring (false).\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"cox/#Cox-Proportional-Hazards-Model","page":"Cox","title":"Cox Proportional Hazards Model","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"cox/","page":"Cox","title":"Cox","text":"The Cox proportional hazards model is a semiparametric regression model used to fit survival models without knowing the distribution.
