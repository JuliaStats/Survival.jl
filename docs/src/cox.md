# Cox Proportional Hazards Model

The [Cox proportional hazards model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_hazards_model) is a semiparametric regression used to fit survival models without knowing the distribution. It is based on the assumption that different covariates affect the hazard function multiplicatively:

```math
\lambda(t|X_i) = \lambda_0(t)\exp(X_i\cdot\beta)
```

where ``\lambda(t|X_i)`` is the estimated hazard for sample ``i``, ``\lambda_0`` is the baseline hazard, ``X_i`` the vector of covariates for sample ``i`` and ``\beta`` are the coefficients of the regression.
