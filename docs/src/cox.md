# Cox Proportional Hazards Model

The [Cox proportional hazards model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_hazards_model)
is a semiparametric regression model used to fit survival models without knowing the
distribution. It is based on the assumption that covariates affect the hazard function
multiplicatively. That is,

```math
\lambda(t | X_i) = \lambda_0(t) \exp(X_i \cdot \beta)
```

where ``\lambda(t|X_i)`` is the estimated hazard for sample ``i``, ``\lambda_0`` is the
baseline hazard, ``X_i`` is the vector of covariates for sample ``i``, and ``\beta`` is
the vector of coefficients in the model.
